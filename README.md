Based on the content extracted from your Jupyter notebook, it seems the project is centered around **Audio Recognition**, specifically focusing on **Audio Content and Gender Classification**. The dataset described consists of 25,000 audio tracks aimed at identifying digits and gender from audio recordings. Here's a draft README for your GitHub repository based on this information:

# Audio Recognition 4C16/5C16 Project

## Project Overview
This project aims at developing a deep learning solution for Audio Recognition, focusing on two main tasks:
1. Identifying the digit (0-9) uttered in audio recordings.
2. Classifying the gender of the speaker in the audio recordings.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 25,000 audio tracks, each recording a human voice uttering a single digit. These audio files are pre-processed and stored in `.npy` format, structured as follows in the `dataset` directory:
- `input.npy`: Contains waveform data of the audio recordings, with a shape of `(25000, 8000)`, indicating 25,000 waveforms and 8,000 samples per waveform. Each waveform is normalized, with a duration of 1 second and a sampling frequency of 8 kHz.
- `gender.npy`: Contains gender labels for the corresponding audio recordings.
- `digit.npy`: Contains digit labels for the corresponding audio recordings.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to train neural networks capable of:
- Accurately identifying the digit pronounced in each audio track.
- Determining the gender of the speaker in each audio track.

## Implementation
(Here, you would describe the models you implemented, any specific architectures like CNNs, RNNs, or custom models, and the libraries used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch.)

## Results
(Here, you would summarize the performance of your models, including any metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc., that you used to evaluate the models.)
